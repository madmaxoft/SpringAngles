# SpringAngles
Visualises a 2D triangle network comprised of springs

This project comes from a simple need: I measured my garden and want to plot the resulting shape; however the measurements are imprecise, so they need to be slightly adjusted to produce the final shape. This project tries to implement such an adjustment using a 2D spring system model.
